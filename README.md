The goal was to create an inventory app that will allow the user to maintain an stock levels in a warehouse. The end users will be able to add new items, update the quanity, and set an ideal stock level. The app can notify the end user when stock is running low. 

The app consists of a login screen, a view of the database utilizing the recyler, the ability to add new items, and sms notification setttings. The goal was to provide the user a view of their warehouse through a single pane of glass. The goal was to keep it simple and not overload the end user with data. 

I struggled building the app. I had a tough time and work and overall the experiance was very difficult. Sometimes life is hard and I spent all the time I could on learning, coding and testing. Really I felt the crunch time for the entire duration of the course. I did my best to take big tasks and break them down into small ones. Overall I struggled. Breaking down larger tasks into smaller ones and trying to manage my time as best as possible will carry forward into future projects. I guess I also have to learn to cope with failure. 

Sometimes you try as hard as you can, you put in all the effort you can muster but you still fall short. Accepting that with humility and learning from failures that feel outside your control is a valuble skill. I am hoping in the future that I don't have to struggle like this to complete a class I think is very interesting and valuble. I think that if my life situation was a bit different during this class I would have gotten to have a lot more fun with the material. 

I wish I had better answers in response to this last question and talk about the places and I had to innovate and say that my app was successful but it wasn't. I didn't feel as though I grasped the content well enough and I am going to continue to persevere and study this on my own. I will continue to develop apps and learn. I think I did gain a good foundation and that familiarity with android studio. I am going to use the foundation to grow my skills. I really want to build an app and I have a couple real world use cases I want to target, even if the app's audiance is just me. 

I look forward to building more apps and applying what I have learned. I wish I had taken this class under better circumstances.
